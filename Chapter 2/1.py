a = 5
b = 5

print(a + b) # 10

# what is variable?
# understanding with and example will be helpful so we basically use variable for saving a lot of code in one word or a smaller name so will be easier to call anywhere through his name
# print(a + b) # 10
# In this a represent 5 while b also represent 5 because there value above is declare 5 so it represent it.
# anoother example is that if a person put some sugar in sugar gar and call sugar gar when needed it mean that person want to use the sugar not the sugar jar so we use jar to save sugar same in programming we use variable to save in one small name or one word
